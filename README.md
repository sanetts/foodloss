# React + Vite

Project Aim: addressing both food waste and hunger through efficient donation and distribution of surplus food items. 

Features:
1. Donation Management: Donors can easily add details of surplus food items, including item name, quantity, expiration date, and pickup location. This streamlines the donation process and ensures that relevant information is provided for potential recipients.
2. Item Search and Filtering: Users can search, sort, and filter food items based on various criteria such as food categories, expiration date, and proximity. This makes it easier for users to find suitable donations that match their needs.
3. Proximity Mapping: The application calculates the distance and duration between users and food items, enabling efficient pickup coordination. This feature is crucial for ensuring that donated food reaches those in need in a timely manner.
4. Pickup Request Handling: Potential recipients can submit requests for pickup of specific food items they are interested in receiving. They can provide details such as their contact information and preferred pickup time, streamlining the distribution process.
5. Communication Facilitation: The application facilitates communication between donors and recipients through an in-app messaging feature. This allows recipients to message donors to gather more details about the items and negotiate pickup arrangements.











This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
